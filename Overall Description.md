# 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product perspective
  
 Ritual Runner is a side scrolling platformer game made during Global Game Jam 2016. We had approximately 48 hours to create the game and it might show in some aspects, for example in the look and functionality of the game. 


## 2.2 Product Functions

The core mechanics of ritual runner include the ability to jump, and the inablity to stop running. The player must avoid running into and crashing with the obstacles and platforms in the game. When you reach the end of the level, you win. 

## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The game's bright colours and simple gameplay  mechanics make the game attractive to all ages. Ritual runner has no violence or scary imagery, and it could be easily implimented as a mobile game. It is desinged purely for entertainment purposes, and to be played over and over again. The increasingly challenging levels offer re-play value and beating the game feels rewarding.



## 2.4  Operating Environment

As of the moment, Ritual Runner can be downloaded to the pc from the Global Game Jam website. It can also be played straight from the browser. Our team is concidering the possibility of mobile verison in the future.

## 2.5 Desingn and Implimentation Constraints

<Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).>

The initial developement time was limited to 48 hours, and it shows in the current product. However, we are planning to continue updating the game on our freetime. 

<TBD: Design conventions, programming standards>


## 2.6 User Documentation

<List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.>

The Global Game Jam website has the installation manual for the game. Because of the simple mechanics of the product, we didn't see the need for gameplay tutorials or walkthrough videos. The game also has a public github repository for anyone interested in the game's code and other components.


## 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies 


We are hoping to release the game on Google Play in the future. We hope to get some further funding for the project from the possible ad revenue or microtransactions. We also have to prepare for the project being unsuccesful.
