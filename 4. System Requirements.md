# 4.	System Features

## 4.1	Jumping mechanic

### 4.1.1	Description and Priority

The jumping mechanic allows the player to manuever upcoming obstacles and defeat the levels. It is one of the core features of the game, so it is considered a High priority feature.
If the jupming mecahic is not optimized enough, it can dramatically affect the player's gameplay experience. The jumping mechanic should also be noted during level design.

Review:
 - Benefit: 9
 - Penalty: 8
 - Cost: 6
 - Risk: 9

### 4.1.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

The player needs to wait for the optimal moment to jump to avoid obstacles. The jump starts immediately when the player presses the jump button. The jump height and speed need to be optimized so that the player can easily memorize when to jump, so that he or she can advance through the level when starting over. In some cases, the player needs to do continuous jumping by immediately pressing the jump button after landing to pass certain sections of the game.

### 4.1.3	Functional Requirements

 - REQ-1: Jump button input processing
 - REQ-2: Aerial physics processing
 - REQ-3: Gravitational effect
 - REQ-4: Ensure the player is on ground, otherwise it cannot jump
 - REQ-5: Collision logic with obstacles to trigger game loss

## 4.2 Dash

### 4.2.1	Description and Priority

The dash mechanic allows the player to quickly force itself down into the ground to avoid obstacles while in air. The dash mechanic works in conjunction with the jump mechanic, but the jump mechanic is not dependent on dash mechanic. The dash mechanic is also used much less than the jump mechanic, making it a Low priority.

Review:
 - Benefit: 4
 - Penalty: 1
 - Cost: 3
 - Risk: 1

### 4.2.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

The player needs to wait for the optimal moment to use dash to avoid aerial obstacles. The dash starts immediately when the player presses the dash button. Like the jump mechanic, the dash mechanic needs optimal timing to be the most efficient and challenging for the player.

### 4.2.3	Functional Requirements

 - REQ-1: Dash button input processing
 - REQ-2: Aerial physics processing
 - REQ-3: Ensure the player is in air, otherwise it cannot dash
 - REQ-4: Collision logic with obstacles to trigger game loss

## 4.3 Win and loss conditions

### 4.3.1 Description and priority

If the player successfully avoids obstacles to reach the end of the level, the player wins the game. In contrast, the player loses the game if it fails to avoid obstacles. After either the win or loss condition is triggered, the player has the ability to immediately restart the level, making it a fast-paced, fast-replay experience. The importance of fast-replay makes the win and loss condition mechanics a High priority.

 - Benefit: 9
 - Penalty: 3
 - Cost: 3
 - Risk: 6

### 4.3.2 Functional requirements

 - REQ-1: Obstacle collision processing
 - REQ-2: Game victory trigger process, effects and user interface components
 - REQ-3: Game loss trigger process, effects and user interface components
 - REQ-4: Game restart functionality
