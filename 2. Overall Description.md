# 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product perspective
  
Ritual Runner is a side scrolling platformer game made during Global Game Jam 2016. We had approximately 48 hours to create the game and it might show in some aspects, for example in the look and functionality of the game. 

## 2.2 Product Functions

The core mechanics of ritual runner include the ability to jump, and the inablity to stop running. The player must avoid running into and crashing with the obstacles and platforms in the game. When you reach the end of the level, you win. 

## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The game's bright colours and simple gameplay  mechanics make the game attractive to all ages. Ritual runner has no violence or scary imagery, and it could be easily implimented as a mobile game. It is desinged purely for entertainment purposes, and to be played over and over again. The increasingly challenging levels offer re-play value and beating the game feels rewarding.

## 2.4  Operating Environment

As of the moment, Ritual Runner can be downloaded to the pc from the Global Game Jam website. It can also be played straight from the browser. Our team is concidering the possibility of mobile verison in the future.

## 2.5 Design and Implimentation Constraints

The initial developement time was limited to 48 hours, and it shows in the current product. However, we are planning to continue updating the game on our freetime. 

Design conventions included basic conventions of working with the Unity engine; organized assets, object-oriented programming and minimal hardcoding.

For programming conventions, we followed some basic naming conventions. Classes were named with upper first letters, public variables were named with lower first letters and private variables were prefixed with the *m* letter.

## 2.6 User Documentation

The Global Game Jam website has the installation manual for the game. Because of the simple mechanics of the product, we didn't see the need for gameplay tutorials or walkthrough videos. The game also has a public github repository for anyone interested in the game's code and other components.

## 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies 

We are hoping to release the game on Google Play in the future. We hope to get some further funding for the project from the possible ad revenue or microtransactions. We also have to prepare for the project being unsuccesful.
